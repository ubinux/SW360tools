# SW360tools

The tools for importing SPDX into SW360tools and exporting information from SW360tools. The SW360tool is deployed in the same server as SW360.

## Using SW360tools

For using the SW360tools, please see the following basic workflows:

    1. Basic workflow for importing component, release and license by SPDX file.
    2. Basic workflow for exporting component, release and license via SPDXlite file.
 
Basic workflows for importing component, release and license by SPDX file:

    1. In SW360tools, open the Import screen by the following link:
	http://<host_ip>:8080/import

	2. Click on "Choose Files" button and select 1 or many files.

	3. Click on "Upload SPDX FILE" button.

	4. System dislays status message.

Basic workflow for exporting component, release and license via SPDXlite file

	1. In SW360tools, open the Export screen by the following link:
	http://<host_ip>:8080/import/export

	2. Select the field on the left hand side panel that you want to export and click ">" button. ">>" button will move all fields on the left panel to the right panel. All available fields will be exported.
	
	3. Select the field on the right hand side panel that you do not want to export and click "<" button. "<<" button will move all fields on the right panel to the left panel. No field will be exported.

	4. Click "Export SPDX lite" button. System will download SPDX lite file. Now, you can view the exported SPDX lite report.

	5. If there is no release on component, the export might export an empty Excel file. The reason is that SPDX data is stored on release and if there is no release, system has nothing to export.
